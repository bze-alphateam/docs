# Getting Started

This technical documentation for Beezee will provide you detailed information about chain setup, node and validator setup, command line interface to navigate node and/or validator as well as other services included in Beezee eco-system.

:::tip NOTE
In case you are interested in setting up full node or validator, we strongly recommend to start from Testnet deployment.
Testnet provides risk free environment where you can afford to make any type of mistake and you will not loose your funds as this chain operates on tokens with no value.
